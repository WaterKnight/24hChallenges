A &quot;Santa Hat&quot; is a floppy, red hat trimmed in white fur traditionally worn during Christmas. 

It is team-colored. If you want team-color on it, use an ability like &quot;Life Regeneration Aura (Neutral)&quot; to attach it to the &quot;head&quot; attachment point. If you want it to be red, no matter the team of the unit, use an ability like &quot;Sphere&quot; to attach it. 

This is the &quot;classic&quot; version of the two Christmas head attachments I have submitted. The more &quot;medieval&quot; version can be found [url=&quot;http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/models-530/greathelm-winter-151807/&quot;]here[/url].
